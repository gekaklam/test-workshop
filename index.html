<h2>General Information</h2>

<!--
    INTRODUCTION

    Edit the general explanatory paragraph below if you want to change
    the pitch.

<p>


<p>
  This hands-on workshop teaches basic concepts, skills and tools for working more
  effectively and reproducibly with data in Juypter notebooks.
</p>

<p>
  <b>The following are the overarching learning objectives for the curriculum.</b>
  <ul>
    <li>Understand the value of reproducible research practices for more effective research for the current and future you.</li>
    <li>Understand the value of reproducible research practices for advancing research as a whole.</li>
    <li>Understand what is meant by making your research more reproducible.</li>
    <li>Know practices to make your research more reproducible, in particular by using Jupyter Notebooks, and have the skills to do so.</li>
    <li>Have the confidence and foundation to continue improving reproducibility of your research.</li>
    <li>Understand whatâ€™s possible to further advance reproducibility of your research.</li>
  </ul>

  <strong>Please also see the <a href="https://reproducible-science-curriculum.github.io/rr-jupyter-workshop/">general overiew of the workshop and the curriculum</a>.</strong>
</p>
<p>
  Participants should bring their laptops and plan to participate actively. By the end of the workshop learners should be able to more effectively manage and analyze data and be able to apply the tools and approaches directly to their ongoing research.
</p>


<!--
    AUDIENCE

    SYLLABUS

    Show what topics will be covered.

    1. If your workshop is R rather than Python, remove the comment
    around that section and put a comment around the Python section.
    2. Some workshops will delete SQL.
    3. Please make sure the list of topics is synchronized with what you
    intend to teach.
    4. You may need to move the div's with class="col-md-6" around inside
    the div's with class="row" to balance the multi-column layout.

    This is one of the places where people frequently make mistakes, so
    please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run

      SETUP

      Delete irrelevant sections from the setup instructions.  Each
      section is inside a 'div' without any classes to make the beginning
      and end easier to find.

      This is the other place where people frequently make mistakes, so
      please preview your site before committing, and make sure to run
      'tools/check' as well.
    -->

  <h2 id="setup">Setup</h2>

  To participate in this workshop, you will need working copies of the
  described software. Please make sure to install everything (or at least to download
  the installers) before the start of your workshop. Participants should bring and use
  their own laptops to insure the proper setup of tools for an efficient workflow
  once you leave the workshop.

  <h3>
    Jupyter notebook
  </h3>
  The best way to install the Jupyter notebook is to use Anaconda.
  <p>
    Regardless of how you choose to install it, please make sure you install Python version 3.x (e.g., 3.4 is fine).
  <p>
    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-6">
	<h4>Windows</h4>
	<ol>
	  <li> Open <a href="http://continuum.io/downloads">http://continuum.io/downloads</a> with your web browser.
	  <li> Download the Python 3 installer for Windows.
	  <li> Install Python 3 using all of the defaults for installation except make sure to check *Make Anaconda the default Python*.
	</ol>

      <h3>Text Editor</h3>

      <p>
	When you're writing code, it's nice to have a text editor that is
	optimized for writing code, with features like automatic
	color-coding of key words.  The default text editor on Mac OS X and
	Linux is usually set to Vim, which is not famous for being
	intuitive.  if you accidentally find yourself stuck in it, try
	typing the escape key, followed by <code>:q!</code> (colon, lower-case 'q',
	exclamation mark), then hitting Return to return to the shell.

            nano is a basic editor and the default that instructors use in the workshop.
            To install it,
            download the <a href="{{site.swc_installer}}">Software Carpentry Windows installer</a>
            and double click on the file to run it.
            <strong>This installer requires an active internet connection.</strong>
